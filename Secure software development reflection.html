								<p>Secure software development: reflective writing
									Throughout the completion of the secure software development module my understanding of the software development cycle has changed and adapted with security in mind. Following the ISO/IEC Standard 27000 was crucial while working throughout the module and its implementation within the group application project was paramount to the success of the team. A weakness I found throughout the module was time management, assigning time to group work, the unit work and a fulltime job was difficult and led to certain areas such as the unit work being rushed. Reflecting, it would be beneficial to understand that working ahead of schedule with the unit work to leave ample time for the application project is necessary to reduce stress and workload. Furthermore, the implementation of ideas within the group work was above what was required and led to multiple key ideas being opted out of the final application. Going forward planning less but stronger ideas such as authentication and encryption would be beneficial to the development of the application. When working in a team we found that assigning jobs was the logical way of implementing work, it was throughout the design development phase that we found one member took a shine to team leading and this substantially helped the team with job assigning and keeping on schedule. Further acknowledging to the need for leadership within the team we also booked weekly meetings to support the development process. This was essential to our success as a team. By including constant contact and understanding each of our inputs and roles we were able to work together almost seamlessly and create our application. Looking forward I would like to expand on my coding and programming skills so in future when I am working within a team, I can support the coding side further as I personally felt ill equipped for this project and found myself falling behind in some aspects of the development. Although my understanding of data security was implemented into the work.
									Overall, I found the secure software development module challenging but rewarding. Working within a team was time consuming however the support and teaching shared by the team was instrumental in the learning environment as well as the creation of First4Aid. Moving forward in my job role and in my studies I want to work on my time management and spent extra time to research further into the coding side and begin to understand further the skills provided and taught within the modules.<br />
