								<p>“Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security”
									Data protection and GDPR Compliance are essential to companies working with personal data, however employees or people within the workplace are a risk to the safety of this data. By managing people within the workplace data can be protected, 5 ways of protecting and managing using ISO/IEC Standard 27000 is policy, competence, audit, access control and authentication.
									Access control ensures that employees cannot access areas or information they should not require to complete their job such as read/write access for areas of the company’s databases. Limiting access depending on job role inputs a level of structure and security to the company.
									Authentication is another method that limits who can access data. This could be through login systems, physical doors or using protection such as multifactor authentication to limit how someone is authenticated. By guaranteeing who is accessing the data you have knowledge of who is a risk and can implement measures to protect data further.
									Further control can be achieved by implementing policies. The use of policy within a workplace gives employees structure and understanding of what is required of the employee as well as the consequences of not following them.  
									Audits can support employees by informing them of ways they can improve as well as providing sufficient data to the employer of who is competent in data security and who requires further training. 
									Overall, people within a company are the biggest risk of cyber security when they are not trained and managed correctly following the ISO/IEC Standard 27000.
